        <h1>About Integral Tech Systems</h1>
        <p>
          Technology should serve people — not the other way around. Integral Tech Systems exists
          to bring calm, thoughtful problem-solving to everyday tech issues.

          <h2>The core idea</h2>
          <p>
            Many tech services focus on speed, upsells, or impressing you with jargon.
            We focus on something different: clear thinking, ethical guidance, and solutions
            that fit the person sitting at the keyboard, not just the machine itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            We combine careful reasoning, modern tools (including AI), and patient explanation
            to help you understand what’s going on with your technology and what to do next.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h2>Who’s behind it</h2>
          <p>
            Integral Tech Systems is led by a detail-oriented problem-solver with years of hands-on
            experience in technology, troubleshooting, and real-world logistics — and a deep respect
            for clear communication and personal integrity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of chasing trends for their own sake, we prioritize reliability, longevity, and
            practical setup choices that match your actual needs.

        <h2>How we use AI — and how we don’t</h2>
        <p>
          We believe AI is a powerful tool for research, analysis, and pattern recognition —
          not a replacement for human judgment, ethics, or responsibility.

        <div class="bullet-list">
          <div class="bullet-item">
            <h3>AI as an assistant, not the boss</h3>
            <p>
              We use AI to speed up troubleshooting, explore options, and generate written summaries —
              but every recommendation is filtered through human reasoning and experience.

            <h3>Your data stays yours</h3>

              We do not feed your private information or sensitive details into public AI tools
              without your explicit permission.

            <h3>Clarity</h3>
            <p>
              You deserve to understand what’s happening with your technology. We explain issues
              and solutions in plain language.

              We recommend what we’d do if it were our own system. No scare tactics —
              just honest, reasoned guidance.

            <h3>Adaptation</h3>
            <p>
              Technology changes quickly. We keep learning so we can keep guiding, adjusting,
              and improving your setup over time.
